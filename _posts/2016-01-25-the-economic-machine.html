<p>Fifteen days into 2016 and the markets have already soured, leaving every financial pundit to claim that we are finally in another recession. Stocks droppingand bears roaring, all while retirement dreams fade away. What happened to that wonderful Christmas holiday with the eggnog you double spiked? <em>Sigh..</em></p>

<p>Don't panic. Trying to navigate the product management process in foggy economic times not only builds character, but can be a great opportunity to really understand the market's perception of your product.</p>

<p>Depending on the economy's momentum, key product roadmap milestones can also be adjusted to maximize impact and perception. For example, if the economy's growth is in severe decline, perhaps an incremental update of your offering is more appropriate until the market calms and can react positively to your innovation.</p>

<p>Isn't economics boring? Don't product management teams have enough on their plates without worrying about becoming ECONOMISTS?? In most cases, a very high level of knowledge is all that is needed.</p>

<p>The excellent video below provides an overview with clear visuals to understand how critical parts of the "economic machine" fit together. Hopefully, you can use this knowledge to your advantage when understanding your customers' purchasing behavior, and plan the best strategy for timing product releases.</p>
